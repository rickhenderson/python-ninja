# ADTs and Their Uses

If you've studied _abstract data types_ or __ADT__s then you should be familiar with concepts and the abstract data structures such as _Stacks_, _Queues_, _Linked Lists_, and perhaps even _Binary Search Trees__ (BST)s. They may not seem useful when you first start learning them, but here are some examples of how these data structures are used in applications. I've picked up a few unusual ones along the way that you may not study in a first or second __data structures__ class, but they are interesting enough to be included here.

__Stacks__: Stacks are used quite often in operating system design as well as compiler design. Other uses include solving mazes, parsing text (ie. looking for balanced brackets or parenthese in math equations), travelling other data structures such as tress in a _depth-first_ manner. Due to their FILO (First In Last Out) nature, stacks are useful when trying to retrieve data in reverse order to how they were stored.
